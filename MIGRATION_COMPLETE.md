- **Auto-scaling**: Handles traffic spikes without configuration
- **Global Distribution**: Low latency worldwide

## 📋 Preserved Functionality

### ✅ All Original Features Work

- **Google OAuth**: Identical user experience, better performance
- **Airtable Integration**: Both OAuth and API key methods supported
- **Stripe Payments**: Complete payment processing and subscriptions
- **Domain Isolation**: Sessions still isolated per domain
- **JWT Authentication**: Same security model, faster validation

## 🎯 Next Steps

### 1. Setup and Deploy (Required)

```bash
# 1. Install Wrangler CLI
npm install -g wrangler
wrangler login

# 2. Set up KV namespaces
npm run setup:kv

# 3. Configure environment variables
wrangler secret put GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
wrangler secret put GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
wrangler secret put JWT_SECRET
wrangler secret put STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
wrangler secret put STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
# Optional: wrangler secret put AIRTABLE_CLIENT_ID
# Optional: wrangler secret put AIRTABLE_CLIENT_SECRET

# 4. Deploy to Cloudflare
npm run worker:deploy
```

### 2. Update OAuth Applications (Required)

**Google Cloud Console:**

- Update redirect URIs from your old backend URL to your new domains
- Change: `https://your-backend.com/auth/google/callback`
- To: `https://yourdomain.com/auth/google/callback`

**Airtable Developer Hub:**

- Update redirect URIs similarly
- Change: `https://your-backend.com/auth/airtable/callback`
- To: `https://yourdomain.com/auth/airtable/callback`

### 3. Configure Custom Domains (Required)

Choose your approach:

**Option A: Cloudflare Pages (Most users)**

```bash
# Build and deploy static site
npm run build
wrangler pages deploy .next --project-name your-marketplace

# Add custom domains in Cloudflare Pages dashboard
```

**Option B: Cloudflare for SaaS (Enterprise/High-volume)**

- Contact Cloudflare sales for unlimited custom domains
- Automatic SSL certificate management
- Perfect for marketplace platforms like Gumroad

### 4. DNS Configuration (Required)

For each custom domain:

```
Type: CNAME
Name: @ (or your subdomain)
Value: your-worker.workers.dev (or your Pages domain)
```

### 5. Testing Checklist

- [ ] **Authentication**: Test Google OAuth login on multiple domains
- [ ] **Domain Isolation**: Verify sessions don't share between domains
- [ ] **Payments**: Test Stripe product creation and purchases
- [ ] **Integrations**: Test Google Sheets and Airtable functionality
- [ ] **Performance**: Notice faster response times
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Check Cloudflare Analytics dashboard

### 6. Cleanup Old Infrastructure (After testing)

Once everything works perfectly:

- [ ] **Shut down Express backend** (save $25-100/month)
- [ ] **Remove Vercel project** (if migrating completely)
- [ ] **Update documentation** for your team
- [ ] **Delete old backend files** from repository

## 🎯 Business Impact

wrangler tail --format pretty | grep "yourdomain.com"

# Check KV usage
wrangler kv:namespace list
```

### Cloudflare Dashboard

- **Analytics**: Request volume, performance, errors
- **Security**: Attack patterns, blocked requests
- **Performance**: Cache hit rates, bandwidth usage

### Custom Metrics

Your worker now supports custom business metrics:

```javascript
// Track important events
await env.ANALYTICS.put(
  `purchase:${domain}`,
  JSON.stringify({
    amount: 100,
    timestamp: Date.now(),
    userId: user.id,
  })
);
```

## 🚨 If Something Goes Wrong

### Quick Rollback Plan

If you need to roll back quickly:

1. Keep your old Express backend running initially
2. Update DNS back to old setup
3. Fix issues with new system
4. Switch DNS back when ready
